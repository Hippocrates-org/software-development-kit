## clinical@METEOR Packages

The following table serves as both regulatory status overview and project roadmap.  If a package is on this list, the functionality is tentatively on the project roadmap.  If it's on the list but doesn't have a badge, it's still in research and design phase.  If it's got a badge, it's under continuous improvement process.  And if it's a green badge, it's a candidate for regulatory review.
